--1. How many customers are in each city? Your solution should include the city name and the number of customers sorted from highest to lowest.

SELECT city, COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customer 
FROM SampleRetail.sale.customer
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY number_of_customer DESC;

SELECT city, COUNT(city) AS number_of_customer 
FROM SampleRetail.sale.customer
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY number_of_customer DESC;


--2. Find the total product quantity of the orders. Your solution should include order ids and quantity of products.

SELECT order_id, sum(quantity) AS total_product_quantity
FROM SampleRetail.sale.order_item
GROUP BY order_id;


--3. Find the first order date for each customer_id.

SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
FROM SampleRetail.sale.orders
GROUP BY customer_id;


--4. Find the total amount of each order. Your solution should include order id and total amount sorted from highest to lowest.

SELECT order_id, SUM(list_price) AS total_amount
FROM SampleRetail.sale.order_item
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;


--5. Find the order id that has the maximum average product price. Your solution should include only one row with the order id and average product price.

SELECT TOP(1) order_id, AVG(list_price) AS total_amount
FROM SampleRetail.sale.order_item
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;


--6. Write a query that displays brand_id, product_id and list_price sorted first by brand_id (in ascending order), and then by list_price  (in descending order).

SELECT brand_id, list_price, product_id
FROM SampleRetail.product.product
ORDER BY brand_id ASC, list_price DESC;


--7. Write a query that displays brand_id, product_id and list_price, but this time sorted first by list_price (in descending order), and then by brand_id (in ascending order).

SELECT list_price, brand_id, product_id
FROM SampleRetail.product.product
ORDER BY list_price DESC, brand_id ASC;


--8. Compare the results of these two queries above. How are the results different when you switch the column you sort on first? (Explain it in your own words.)

--The priority has changed. In the first result, the brand_id is sorted in ascending order first, and then list_price was listed in descending order based on the brand_id column. In the second one,  the list_price column is listed in the descending order, and then the brand_id was sorted accordingly in the ascending order.


--9. Write a query to pull the first 10 rows and all columns from the product table that have a list_price greater than or equal to 3000.

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM SampleRetail.product.product
WHERE list_price >= 3000;


--10. Write a query to pull the first 5 rows and all columns from the product table that have a list_price less than 3000.

SELECT TOP 5 *
FROM SampleRetail.product.product
WHERE list_price < 3000
ORDER BY list_price DESC;
--Top 5 prices closest to 3000


--11. Find all customer last names that start with 'B' and end with 's'.

SELECT *
FROM SampleRetail.sale.customer
WHERE last_name LIKE 'B_%s';


--12. Use the customer table to find all information regarding customers whose address is Allen or Buffalo or Boston or Berkeley.

SELECT *
FROM SampleRetail.sale.customer
WHERE city in ('Allen', 'Buffalo', 'Boston', 'Berkeley');
